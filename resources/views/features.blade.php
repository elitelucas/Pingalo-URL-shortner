                Welcome to Pingalo. This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Bitly, Inc.
                <br>(“Bitly”, “we” or “us”) for the collection, use, security and disclosure of personal information
                about you. It also describes your choices regarding use, access, deletion, and correction of your
                personal information.
                <br><span class="content_subtitle">Scope</span><br>
                This Privacy Policy explains how Bitly treats the personal information it gathers when you use or access
                https://bitly.com (the “Site”) or the services, features, content or applications offered by Bitly
                (collectively with the Site, the “Services”), or when you view or interact with a Bitly link (either our
                bit.ly links or one of our branded domains). This Privacy Policy also covers Bitly’s treatment of any
                information about you that Bitly’s customers share with Bitly.

                This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that Bitly does not own or
                control, including other companies’ websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”) that
                you can access through the Services or to individuals that Bitly does not manage or employ. We cannot
                take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of Third Party Services. We encourage you to
                review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access or use.

                <br><span class="content_subtitle">Information We Collect</span><br>
                Bitly may collect personal information about you from the following sources, as described in this
                Privacy Policy, when you (i) register for the Site and the Services, through your user account with
                Bitly, including registering through a third-party social networking service (your “Account”); (ii) use
                the Services; or (iii) view or interact with a Bitly link (either our bit.ly links or one of our branded
                domains) on a third-party website. We collect the following types of information from you, some of which
                might be considered personal information under applicable law.

                <br><span class="content_subtitle">When You Register for a Bitly Account</span><br>
                When you create an Account, we may collect personal information from you, such as your name, phone
                number, company name, industry, job title, company size, email address, and sign-in information. If you
                create an Account using your login information from a third-party account, such as Google, Facebook,
                Apple, or Twitter, we will access and collect the personal information about you that the third-party
                account provides (which is based on your privacy settings with the third-party account), so that you can
                log into your Account with us. We use your contact information to send you information about our
                Services and communicate with you about your Account, your activities on our Site and Services and
                policy changes. You may unsubscribe from receiving certain types of these messages through your Account
                settings, although Bitly reserves the right to contact you when we believe it is necessary, such as for
                administrative and account management purposes.

                Some features of the Services allow registered users to provide their own content to the Services, such
                as written descriptions of URLs, comments, images and video. Unless you request deletion of your
                personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, all content submitted by you to the Services
                may be retained by Bitly, even after you terminate your Account and may continue to be shared by third
                parties, as described in this Privacy Policy.

                <br><span class="content_subtitle">When You Create a Bitly Link</span><br>
                One feature of the Services is the ability to create shortened uniform resource locators (URLs) of
                websites (“Bitly Links” or “Bitlinks”). Users can create Bitly Links without registering for an account.
                When you create a Bitly Link, Bitly collects and stores both the original URL and the shortened URL and,
                if you are logged in to your Account, we will associate that information with your Account. Bitly also
                collects and stores your IP address, your geolocation data (which we derive from your IP address), the
                time and date on which you shortened the original URL, and if you share a Bitly Link on a social
                networking platform, the name of the platform and your username on that platform.


                <br><span class="content_subtitle"> When You Interact With a Bitly Link</span><br>
                Bitly automatically collects personal information about the interaction (such as clicks or views) with
                every Bitly Link created through the Services (either our bit.ly links or one of our branded domains) on
                a third-party website. This information includes, but is not limited to: (i) the IP address and location
                derived from the IP address; (ii) internet or other electronic network activity information like the
                referring websites or services; (iii) the time and date of each access; (iv) device settings, such as
                browser type, operating system, and language; (v) cookies, as described below, and mobile advertising
                identiﬁers and (v) information about sharing of the Bitly Link on Third Party Services (collectively,
                “Bitly Link Metrics”). As described in this policy, we use Bitly Link Metrics to provide the Services,
                to understand and analyze how our Services are used and to identify trends, and to detect, deter and
                prevent malicious, fraudulent or unlawful activity. Please see the “Information We May Share” section of
                this Privacy Policy for a description of how we may share information we collect when you create, view
                or interact with Bitly Links.

                <br><span class="content_subtitle"> Other Information We Automatically Collect</span><br>
                When you visit the Site, we automatically collect (i) your IP address and location derived from the IP
                address; (ii) internet or other electronic network activity information, like the referring websites or
                services; (iii) the time and date of each access; (iv) device settings, such as browser type, operating
                system, and language; and (v) cookie information. This type of data enables us and third parties
                authorized by us to ﬁgure out how often individuals use parts of the Site so that we can analyze and
                improve them.

                We may receive a conﬁrmation when you open an email from us. We use this conﬁrmation to improve our
                customer service.
